This music player works using python. 
To start, you first need to install the modules in the python file that you don't already have.
Then add any songs you want to the "/songs/" folder. They need to be mp3 files. the name of the file should be the name of the song.
Then if you have any thumbnails for these songs, then add them to thumbnails folder. The picture corresponding to the song should have the same name as the name of the song file. 
Then you can run the player, and enjoy your music!
